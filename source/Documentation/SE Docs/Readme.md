# ML project 23/24-01 Implement the SDR Classifier

Hello Professor I have gone through the SDR classifier program what you have provided as for reference. And I observed the provided code is an implementation of a Sparse Distributed Representation (SDR) classifier in c#. This classifier is designed to accept a binary input pattern (SDR) and outputs a predicted distribution of classes. The key functionalities include learning from input patterns and performing inference to predict class labels.

Inference:

The 'infer' method performs inference for a given pattern and returns a dictionary containing the predicted distributions for each step in 'self-steps'.
The 'inferSingleStep' method performs inference for a single step, taking a pattern and weight matrix as input.
