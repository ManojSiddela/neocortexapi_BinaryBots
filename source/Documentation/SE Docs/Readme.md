Understanding SDR 

 Sparse Distributed Representations (SDRs) are binary vectors with a large number of elements, most of which are zeros. They are used to represent patterns in an efficient and distributed manner.

Implement reconstruction logic: SDR reconstruction involves taking a sparse binary vector and reconstructing the original input pattern or a close approximation of it. This can involve various techniques, such as overlap-based reconstruction or using classifiers.
