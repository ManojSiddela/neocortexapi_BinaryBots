# ML project 23/24-01 Implement the SDR Classifier

Hello Professor I have gone through the SDR classifier program what you have provided as for reference. And I observed the provided code is an implementation of a Sparse Distributed Representation (SDR) classifier in c#. This classifier is designed to accept a binary input pattern (SDR) and outputs a predicted distribution of classes. The key functionalities include learning from input patterns and performing inference to predict class labels.

Initialization:

The constructor initializes the SDRClassifier with parameters such as steps, alpha (learning rate), actValueAlpha, and verbosity.
