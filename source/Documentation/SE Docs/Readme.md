# ML project 23/24-01 Implement the SDR Classifier

Hello Professor I have gone through the SDR classifier program what you have provided as for reference. And I observed the provided code is an implementation of a Sparse Distributed Representation (SDR) classifier in c#. This classifier is designed to accept a binary input pattern (SDR) and outputs a predicted distribution of classes. The key functionalities include learning from input patterns and performing inference to predict class labels.

Iearning and Inference:

The compute method processes one input sample. It takes parameters like recordNum (record number of the input), patternNZ (active indices of the input pattern), classification (classification information), learn (boolean indicating whether to learn), and infer (boolean indicating whether to perform inference).
During learning, the connection weights between input units and output units are adjusted based on the classification information to maximize the likelihood of the model.
During inference, the method calculates the predicted distribution of class labels based on the learned weights.
