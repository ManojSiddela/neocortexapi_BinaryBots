Understanding SDR 

 Sparse Distributed Representations (SDRs) are binary vectors with a large number of elements, most of which are zeros. They are used to represent patterns in an efficient and distributed manner.

Implement reconstruction logic: SDR reconstruction involves taking a sparse binary vector and reconstructing the original input pattern or a close approximation of it. This can involve various techniques, such as overlap-based reconstruction or using classifiers.

input_size = 100
column_count = 10
input_pattern = np.random.rand(input_size)
spatial_pooler = SpatialPooler(input_size, column_count)
overlap = spatial_pooler.compute_overlap(input_pattern)
active_columns = spatial_pooler.inhibit_columns(overlap)

sdr_reconstructor = SDRReconstructor(input_size, column_count)
reconstructed_pattern = sdr_reconstructor.reconstruct_input(active_columns)

print("Original Input Pattern:", input_pattern)
print("Reconstructed Input Pattern:", reconstructed_pattern)
